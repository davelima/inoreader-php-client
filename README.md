Inoreader PHP Client
====================

This is a simple wrapper for the [Inoreader API](http://www.inoreader.com/developers/) that
let you fetch RSS/Atom feeds from multiple sources and manage subscriptions using PHP.

All you need to start is create an [Inoreader account](http://www.inoreader.com/) and an
[new application](http://www.inoreader.com/developers/register-app). With this, you'll be
able to manage your account from this API client.
